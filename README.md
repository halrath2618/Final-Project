🎮 Embark on the Journey of a Legend — "Lost Between Realms" 🌌
Step into the enigmatic world of Lost Between Realms, a gripping 3D singleplayer RPG roguelike that thrusts you into the perilous odyssey of Zino, a young and fearless explorer. In a universe where parallel realities collide, you’ll uncover ancient mysteries and confront unimaginable challenges.

🛡️ Choose Your Path, Forge Your Destiny
At the start of your adventure, you’ll select a single profession — each with its own distinct traits that shape Zino’s combat style and weapon mastery. Your choice doesn’t just define how you fight; it unlocks unique abilities and growth paths waiting to be discovered.

🗺️ A World of Secrets, A Realm of Chaos
While the map remains fixed, the monsters you face are randomly generated, ensuring every run is a fresh, unpredictable battle. Strategy and skill are your greatest allies as you navigate treacherous terrain, uncover hidden treasures, and survive the ever-shifting threats that lurk in every corner.

🤝 Meet the Souls Within
Beyond combat, you’ll encounter a cast of compelling characters, each with their own stories and quests. Your decisions shape the narrative, leading to diverse outcomes and rich, immersive experiences.

🌟 A Tribute to the Furry Community
Crafted to celebrate and grow the Vietnamese Furry community — and reach the global fandom — Lost Between Realms features characters with bold personalities and unique designs. The movement began in 2010 in Ho Chi Minh City, and today, it thrives stronger than ever.
